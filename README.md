##  ❔ Frequently Asked Questions

**1- How do you create a .asi based on a c# dll?**

A: It's thanks to a function in my [Hydra Protector](https://github.com/DestroyerDarkNess/Hydra), There's a video showing how to do this in the [Universal.Hexa.ImGui.Hook](https://github.com/DestroyerDarkNess/Universal.Hexa.ImGui.Hook/) repository, This way I manage to have a completely internal C# DLL.
